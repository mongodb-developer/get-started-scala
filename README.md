# Get-Started Scala

Repository to help getting started with MongoDB Scala driver connecting to MongoDB Atlas.

## Information

This Get-Started project uses [MongoDB Scala driver](https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-scala-driver/) version 2.9.0 by default. Although you can change the driver version, the provided code example was only tested against the default version of MongoDB driver. There is no guarantee that the code sample will work for all possible versions of the driver.

## Pre-requisites 

### Docker 

Have Docker running on your machine. You can download and install from: https://docs.docker.com/install/

### MongoDB Atlas

In order to execute the code example, you need to specify `MONGODB_URI` environment variable to connect to a MongoDB cluster. If you don't have any you can create one by signing up [MongoDB Atlas Free-tier M0](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/getting-started/). 


##  Execution Steps 

Execute the helper shell script followed by the MongoDB URI that you would like to connect to. 
```
./get-started.sh "mongodb+srv://usr:pwd@example.mongodb.net/dbname?retryWrites=true"
```
To use a different driver version, specify the driver version after the MongoDB URI. For example:
```
./get-started.sh "mongodb+srv://usr:pwd@example.mongodb.net/dbname?retryWrites=true" 2.8.0
```
